## Overview 

`{openai}` is an R wrapper of OpenAI API endpoints. This package covers Models, Completions, Edits, Images, Embeddings, Files, Fine-tunes, Moderations, and legacy Engines endpoints. The latter endpoints, namely Engines, are left for backward compatibility and will be removed soon.

## Installation

The easiest way to install `{openai}` from CRAN is to use the "official" `install.packages()` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("openai")
```

You can also install the development version of `{openai}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(remotes))
    install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("irudnyts/openai")
```

## Authentication

To use the OpenAI API, you need to provide an API key. First, sign up for OpenAI API on [this page](https://openai.com/api/). Once you signed up and logged in, you need to open [this page](https://beta.openai.com), click on **Personal**, and select **View API keys** in drop-down menu. You can then copy the key by clicking on the green text **Copy**.

By default, functions of `{openai}` will look for `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. If you want to set a global environment variable, you can use the following command (where `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` should be replaced with your actual key):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(
    OPENAI_API_KEY = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
)
```

Otherwise, you can add the key to the `.Renviron` file of the project. The following commands will open `.Renviron` for editing:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(usethis))
    install.packages("usethis")

usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = "project")
```

You can add the following line to the file (again, replace `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your actual key):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**Note:** If you are using GitHub/Gitlab, do not forget to add `.Renviron` to `.gitignore`! 

Finally, you can always provide the key manually to the functions of the package.

## Example

Functions of `{openai}` have self-explanatory names. For example, to create a completion, one can use `create_completion()` function:

```{r}
library(openai)

create_completion(
    model = "ada",
    prompt = "Generate a question and an answer"
)
```

Further, one can generate an image using DALLÂ·E text-to-image model with `create_image()`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
create_image("An astronaut riding a horse in a photorealistic style")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "256px", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/astronaut.png")
```
